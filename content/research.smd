## Pesquisa 

- Reinfocement learning

In my Master's thesis I studied reinfocement learning, where I developed a new algorithm called QSVR.
The algorithm uses a Support Vector Regression algorithm call Online-SVR to estimate the Q-function of a environment.
The results show it can perform better than 
the Deep Q-Network and Q-learning in a environment with small state space and a discrete action space. 
The code of the project is in this [repository](https://github.com/vinybrasil/qsvr).

- Other machine learning algorithms

I also worked on using neural networks along GARCH models in a hybrid approach to improve the forecasting of time series related to soybean price volatility. 
Another article I worked on uses the framework of Bayesian networks along with time series to predict diseases spread along the Brazilian territory.
