Hi! I'm Vinícyus, an undergraduate student of Economics at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR - Universidade Federal do Paraná, in portuguese) located in Curitiba, capital of the State of Paraná, Brazil. I'm focused in learning about mathematical and computational economics, as long as quantitave models to better predict data. I try to solve every problem with a mathematical models and data analysis, always with a background in the scientific literature. 

My work and research
======
I got two main focuses on my research: Macroeconomical simulations and quantitative methods, particularly machine learning. In the first one, on my Bachalor's degrees thesis, I'm currently studing the Dornsburch model, which is a model that try to undestand the movements of the exchange rate after a monetary expansion. I run simulations on Matlab and analyse the results. About the second subject, I'm currently on a project of Iniciação Científica (a kind of Bachalor's thesis, but not required to finish the course) where I study the movements of the Soybean price with econometric tools. I also work at the CiDAMO, a group of the UFPR where we do projects solving real world problems with machine learning. The website of the project is [here](https://www.cidamo.com.br).
